    "A1. MongoDB is a popular NoSQL document-oriented database that uses a flexible schema design to store and manage data. Unlike traditional relational databases that use tables with fixed columns and rows, MongoDB stores data in flexible JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas, which allows for faster and more flexible data modeling and retrieval. \n",

    "1-Documented-Oriented: It is a document-oriented database, which means that it stores data n JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas.\n",

    "2- Scalability: It is designed to scale horizontally across multiple nodes, making it easy to handle large volumes of data and high traffic loads.\n",
